# Personal Portfolio of Nathanael Jageni

This contains all the code I wrote for my personal portfolio hosted on my VPS.

## How was it made ?

I made it using, **Node**, **ParcelJS** and **TailwindCSS**.

### Node and ParcelJS

I mainly use *Node* to work on web based projects. This provides a basic structure and access to several packages for developing on my local machine.

*ParcelJS* is very useful as an alternative of *Webpack*. It helps optimizing all files and makes sure it is compatible with all browsers.

### TailwindCSS

Working with *Tailwind* is extremely quick - this is the right tool for a quick prototype or a side-project. This website was made in one night using basic *HTML5* and Tailwind for shaping the structure.

## What did your learn making it ?

This wasn't my first project using *ParcelJS*  - see [this landing page for a local business.](https://docks-52b.fr)). What I mostly learned was working within a tight time window (3 hours) for making a basic static website and a structure that will be improved in the future.

## What comes next ?

A blog is the next step for this side-project. This blog will be constructed using **Hugo** and hosted on this VPS.
