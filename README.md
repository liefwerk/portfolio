# Personal Portfolio of Nathanael Jageni

This contains all the code I wrote for my personal portfolio. Hosted on Netlify.

## :question: How was it made ?

I made it using, **Node**, **ParcelJS** and **TailwindCSS**.

### Node and ParcelJS

I mainly use *Node* and *npm* to work on web based projects. This provides a basic structure and access to several packages for developing on my local machine.

*ParcelJS* is very useful as an alternative of *Webpack*. It optimizes all types of files and makes sure it is compatible with all browsers.

### :sparkles: TailwindCSS

Working with *TailwindCSS* is extremely quick - this is the right tool for a quick prototype or a side-project. This website was initially made in one night using basic *HTML5* and Tailwind for shaping the structure.

## :orange_book: What did your learn making it ?

This wasn't my first project using *ParcelJS*  - see [this landing page for a local business.](https://docks-52b.fr)). What I mostly learned was working within a tight time window (3 hours) for making a basic static website and a structure that can be improved in the future.

## :watch: What comes next ?

The main issue with that website is its lack of modularity. it gets pretty hard to add edit content because the HTML isn't separated in different templates. What comes next is reshaping the HTML with some template and using JSON for storing the data of the portfolio items.
